# GLA for Generic Log Analyser
The aim of this project is to create a generic log analyzer that can be customized to match your projects.

## Project description
GLA uses the Avalonia framework, a windowing framework similar to Windows Presentation Foundation.

### What is Avalonia ?
Avalonia is an open-source, cross-platform UI development framework distributed under the MIT license. With Avalonia, you can develop applications that work equally well on Linux, Windows, MacOS or the web. This makes it the ideal candidate for developing a generic log analyzer application.
